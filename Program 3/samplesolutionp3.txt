Enter Seed: Welcome to the card game war!
Here are the rules.
You have a pile of cards and I have a pile of cards.
We will each pull the top card off of our respective deck and compare them.
The card with the highest number will win the round and take both cards.
However if there is a tie, then we have to we have to place three cards out and pull one more to compare the final result.
Winner of the tie, will grab all the cards out. However if it's a tie again, then we repeat the same action.
Ready? Here we go!
